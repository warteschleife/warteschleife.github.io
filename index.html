            I started in 2020 with a novice license and a handheld radio for 2m/70cm. My first idea was to build a transceiver. So, I ordered a kit for a CW TRX.
            While I was waiting for the kit, I started learning morse code. When the kit arrived, I became aware that my crafting skills are not the best and
            actually I also didn't really want to go the long way to improve them. But morse code was still fascinating. So learning continued.</div>

                In January 2021, I had the first QSO in CW. It was a sked with a YL and an OM. Then, the Journey slowly started.
                I made a lot of mistakes (fortunately, many hams are very polite) and also had a lot of fun.</div>

                In the middle of 2023, I upgraded to the A class license and now my callsing is DC1MTS.</div>
